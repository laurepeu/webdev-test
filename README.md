- **Flexbox** - use flexbox as much as possible
- **Cross-browser** - ow crap! Sorry about that but yes, it should work on all browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari)
- **Mobile first** - the view must be responsive and usable on all devices (mobile & desktop)
- **Fonts** - Don't spend time on that and use a google font
- **translation** - You have to create a switch in order to switch the content from EN to FR (I18n may help you 😇)
- **header and footer** - No need to code them but you can just create a simple jeader in order to put the language switch.
