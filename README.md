- **Mobile first** - the view must be responsive and usable on all devices (mobile & desktop)
- **Fonts** - Don't spend time on that and use a google font
- **translation** - You have to create a switch in order to switch the content from EN to FR (I18n may help you ðŸ˜‡)
- **header and footer** - No need to code them but you can just create a simple header in order to put the language switch.


## Design

You're lucky, the marketing team did a nice draft in order to help you! ðŸ˜‹
